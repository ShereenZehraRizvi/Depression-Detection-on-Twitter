# Depression-Detection-on-Twitter
This research work carries out Sentiment analysis with respect to depression on Twitter data. This project proposes different deep learning classification techniques which can work as a proficient and adaptable strategy and have also been already effectively utilized in Natural Language Processing tasks. Two Recurrent (bi-directional LSTM) and one Convolutional Neural Networks were applied to a twitter dataset. This study performs a comparison between all three models and identifies the most accurate one among them to apply on actual twitter data. A webpage was designed and connected to the Twitter API in order to get access to the data available on twitter and detect depression among twitter users by applying the best-suited model on the dataset. The study proved that bi-directional LSTM was the most appropriate Deep Learning Model (with an accuracy of almost 95%) for unstructured text data from Twitter because tweets are limited to a short sentence of just two hundred and eighty characters. A research paper is also published in the ICRAI conference.
